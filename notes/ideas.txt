STREETSCOPE — IDEAS (v2)

Last updated: 2025-08-25

ONE-LINER
Spot the next street trend before it’s everywhere.

PROBLEM
Trends pop up fast (reels, shorts, streetwear drops). Most die unnoticed. There’s no simple, public, youth-first way to log, tag, and track early signals.

WHO IT’S FOR
• Teens/Gen Z trend spotters
• Small creators/brands
• Student hackers building mini-startups

ANTI-GOALS
• Not another TikTok clone
• Not a heavy research dashboard
• No scraping bots right now — start manual, community-first

HYPOTHESES
• H1: 10–20 sharp, well-tagged blurbs each week is enough signal.
• H2: Tag taxonomy + weekly highlight makes it sticky.
• H3: Public JSON + tiny site is the fastest MVP.

CORE LOOP
Observe IRL/online → Add a short “trend blurb” (name, why-now, 3 tags, 1 link) → Auto-shows on site → Weekly pick.

MVP (v0.1) MUST-HAVES
• Public repo + Pages site
• 10 seed trend blurbs (JSON)
• Simple list view + tag filter
• Issue template for submissions

FEATURE BACKLOG
NOW
• Seed 10 blurbs
• Tag taxonomy
• Pages list page that reads JSON
NEXT
• Submit form (Google Form → CSV → PR)
• “Trend of the Week” page
LATER
• Upvote system
• Simple charts (per-tag counts)

DATA SOURCES (MANUAL)
• Reels/Shorts, Pinterest Trends, Reddit subs (r/streetwear, r/sneakers), brand lookbooks, IRL photos.

TAG TAXONOMY (STARTER)
accessory, footwear, hoodie, denim, techwear, minimal, diy, reflective, cycling, streetwear, color-pop, vintage, oversized

SUCCESS METRICS (MIN)
• v0.1: 10 blurbs live, 1 weekly highlight
• v0.2: 30+ blurbs, tag search, 3 outside submissions

RISKS
• Low submissions → seed yourself weekly
• Messy tags → keep small, prune monthly

OPEN QUESTIONS
• Keep everything fashion-first or include gadgets/urban-culture?
• Do we need photos per blurb or links are enough?

CHANGELOG
2025-08-25: Created v2 ideas, added 10 seed trends.
